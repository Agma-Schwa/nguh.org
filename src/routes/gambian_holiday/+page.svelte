            The Gambian Holiday Wiki is a rabbithole wiki-formatted story by
            Agma Schwa (King Horror) and Suzudo. The project began in late 2018
            as a joke and had been on hiatus since March of 2020 in preparation
            for the moving of the site from its past location on Fandom to its
            current location as a subdomain of nguh.org.

        <p>
            Some of the content ended up being revamped, and the original Fandom
            continuity had been somewhat invalidated by the time of its arrival
            here on nguh.org; the move was completed in June of 2024, with Ætérnal
            joining as an editor and new entries continuing to be added to the wiki
            ever since.
