			The Gambian Holiday Wiki is a rabbithole wiki-formatted story by
			Agma Schwa (King Horror) and Suzudo. The project began in late 2018
			as a joke and has been on hiatus since March of 2020 in preparation
			for the moving of the site from its current location on Fandom to its
			future location as a subdomain of nguh.org. Much of the content is
			going to be revamped, so the original Fandom continuity may be slightly
			invalidated by the time it arrives here on nguh.org.
