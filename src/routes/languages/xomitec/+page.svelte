        <p>Xo:mi.te; is a Xomaksh language within the broader Qrnql language family, spoken in what we would call todayâ€™s
        Central America and northern South America, with significant minority populations throughout the imperial expanses
        of the Xomil Empire. This includes what we know as Mexico and as far north as Texas.
