    <p><em>:·pʰ.ð.m</em> features nonconcatenative morphology, a highly labial
        phonology, nearly free word order, and a basic set of foundational
        copulas.</p>

    <p>The language itself is not hugely naturalistic, although in the Bez
        universe it does have native speakers and was naturally derived from
        Proto-Prnth. There has been a large amount of manual, let's call it
        "conlangery," put into this language over the years due to its use
        mostly as a poetic and scriptural language.</p>

    <p>The version of <em>:·pʰ.ð.m</em> colloquially spoken is nearly a separate
        language, and would have fully evolved away several times over if
        not for the heavy sense of prescriptivism and conservatism in
        Fifgath culture.</p>

    <p>In Arodjun, the language is referred to as <em>Fitukat</em> or <em>Fitukatau</em>,
        and when we in the real world discuss it we may call it <em>Fifgath</em> or
        "pthm" ['pʰɪ.ðəm].</p>
