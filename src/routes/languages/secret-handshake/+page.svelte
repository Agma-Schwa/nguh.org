        <p>The Secret Handshake (SH) is a language created by Agma Schwa in 2022, intended to be a grammatically simple minilang that
            can be communicated by pulsing the fingers of one hand in different sequences and patterns in order to create meaning.
            Meaning is distinguished by "fingemes" and a selection of four possible rhythyms that can combine up to two fingemes.
