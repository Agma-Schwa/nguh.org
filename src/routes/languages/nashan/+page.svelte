        <p>Nashan is a Sern-Cahilan language spoken along what we know as the Gulf Coast and Mississippi River valley in the 2000's AR,
            with minority populations of speakers throughout the Americas. It is a member of the Sern branch of Sern-Cahilan languages,
            and as such it is descended from Hvasvan and a distant cousin of Arodjun.
