    <h3>A nightmarish creation by Agma Schwa and Ætérnal</h3>
    <p>Gumsmaq is a language created for the sole purpose of causing pain and misery. It was designed to be spoken without the use of the lungs whatsoever.
        Sounds are created exclusively with “chews” and “squelches,” which can almost be accounted for by representations of clicks
        and fricatives in the International Phonetic Alphabet. These weak approximation create the “Romanization” for Gumsmaq.
