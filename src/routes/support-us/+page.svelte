        Keeping up the Agma Schwa Minecraft server, streaming software, and website costs a good amount of money, and
        any support that you think is warranted would be greatly appreciated.

        Become a ngatron at <a href="https://www.patreon.com/nguh">patreon.com/nguh</a>! For as little as $1 per month,
        you can lessen the severity of a money dump this channel has become. You’ll gain access to a secret Discord
        chat, feature your own conlang projects at the end of my videos, and even suggest video ideas. You’ll also get
        to see behind-the-scenes content, including the production of the Dog Days comic!

        Buy Agma Schwa merch from Redbubble and/or Storefrontier! Want a Nguh sticker, or a HyperPirate miniskirt?
        Because both of those things exist!

        Ask me to do a commission! If you’re looking for someone to make a language for you in exchange for some
        monetary compensation and you think I’d be the best one to do it, email me at
        <a href="mailto:nguhmail@gmail.com">nguhmail@gmail.com</a> and we can get started!
