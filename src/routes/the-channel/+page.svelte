            Agma Schwa is dedicated to creating a fun community of descriptivists

            <p>
                Robert Cole, aka 'Nguh', has been writing stories and drawing comics since he was a little kid.
                He began conlanging as a middle schooler in the early 2010s, though he had no idea that "conlanging"
                was a thing, nor that there was an entire online community dedicated to the subject. It was only in
                early 2017 when the early versions of what would become Arodjun took shape for the first time. At
                Arizona State University, Nguh majored in Linguistics (with a minor in Spanish linguistics and a
                certificate in Teaching English to Speakers of Other Languages) and made it his Honors Thesis project to
                develop a full grammar book for the Arodjun language. The language itself was going through many
                changes, and Nguh decided to begin documenting his process on a new YouTube channel.
            </p>

            <p>
                The original idea for the channel was intended to be an equal split of conlang material and Linguistics
                educational content, hosted both by Nguh and his friend Chris. The first video made for the channel was
                actually the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhKiGPkU-lo"> Dene-Yeniseian Language Family
                Connection</a> video essay, though this would not be released for several months.
            </p>

            <p>
                The channel began to take off after the release of the Conlang Speedrun video, and even more
                so after the Rabbid Conlang video. After releasing a video every Tuesday for over 13 months
                uninterrupted but for the occasional 'i am __, do not cry', the channel reached 1000 subscribers
                in early December 2020. After this, Nguh created a Patreon and began to shift the video upload schedule
                to a focus more on quality than quantity.
            </p>

        The biggest project of 2021 was the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKk-kmQlFbM">Conlang Community
        Iceberg</a>, released in May of that year. This was a massive collaboration with over a dozen Conlang content
        creators from YouTube and elsewhere. The production of the Conlang Community Iceberg led to the creation of “Big
        Lang,” a club for conlanging and worldbuilding content creators of all sizes. Together they created the 2021
        Conlanger Census, which yielded 1,034 responses, with plans for future Censuses in the future.
    </p>

    <p>
        In 2022, the channel reached 4,000 subscribers, with several large-scale projects in the works. A comic,
        titled “Dog Days,” has been in production since early 2022. Aeternal created a Conlang-themed
        <a href="/tools/hunger_games_simulator">Hunger Games Simulator</a> on this site in the spring of 2022, which
        quickly exploded in popularity after being featured by several YouTubers, including Zeez Vov Gee 2. A card game,
        under the working title “Prescriptivism: The Game” was created in late 2022, with plans of future printing and
        online multiplayer gaming. In August of 2022, Nguh announced the first-ever “Cursed Conlang Circus,” a challenge
        and contest for people around the internet to create disturbing and weird languages to stick it to the
        gatekeepers who are notorious in the more “serious” elements of the conlang community.
    </p>

    <p>
        The pace of video releases slowed in 2023 for the sake of increasing quality as the audience of the channel grew. In October of 2023,
        after the announcement of the Second Cursed Conlang Circus, the channel passed 10,000 subscribers, a milestone Nguh originally considered
        to be the 'endgame.'

                The content of the Agma Schwa YouTube channel has evolved quite a bit since its first releases in the
                fall of 2019. At first, most videos were explanations of the progress of the development of Arodjun, with
                several translations of popular memes and television scenes.
            </p>

            <p>
                As time went on, production value increased and the preponderance of conlang-related tutorial videos as
                well as conlang showcases and even songs began to increase.
            </p>

            <p>
                After the release of the <a href="/languages/rabbid">Rabbid Language</a> showcase in the fall of 2020,
                Nguh and Ætérnal began a tradition of creating over-the-top cursed conlang showcases. Hyperpirate,
                Gumsmaq, and Santaa are a few examples.

        After the release of the book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/1737701502/">“A Grammar of the Arodjun
        Language”</a> to Amazon Direct Publishing, Nguh began to focus on the many other languages spoken in the Dog
        Days world. :·pʰ.ð.m, Nashan, Permechikan, and Prins are a few examples. This is expected to lead to
        worldbuilding-specific content in the future.
    </p>

    <p>There are also occasional livestreams titled “nguhstreams,” which vary in content from Conlang Counseling to
        Minecraft to Hunger Games and much more.
    </p>

    <p>In late 2021, Nguh began two series of YouTube Shorts which were also posted to TikTok, those being “Conlanging
        101” and “Arodjun 101,” with each giving tips on the very basics of understanding the language-making process
        and how to speak Arodjun, respectively.
